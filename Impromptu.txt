So I really do not know the current issue, as i tried to login into ECR with my AWS Credentials, it worked.
Also, I was able to build,tag and push my image to my repository in ECR while being interactive with the Shell.

I have had close to 6-7 failed runs now, I will still keep trying but first off, I am thinking of creating a new branch after this one to keep it clean, then delete the branch afterwards. That is if the next job fails.



## Major Milestone for Me
Been trying to run  Tf Cloud for weeks now but i keep getting an issue related to file path of my lambda function, lmao i just calmed down during those times and decided to chnage my lambda function path to my modules directory but inside my lambda folder inside the modules directory.

Like this --> /modules/lambda/lambda-function/
Also, path.module is a built-in Terraform function that returns the path to the current module directory ( 
modules/lambda/)

I will fix the whole documentation later, currently I need to finish implementation and testing.
