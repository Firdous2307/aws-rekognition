# Automate Image Upload to S3 with Lambda, EventBridge, and CloudWatch

## Introduction

Automating the image upload process to Amazon S3 with AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and CloudWatch not only streamlines the workflow but also opens up opportunities for advanced image processing.

In this section, I will be exploring how you can use the images stored in my S3 bucket for detection through Amazon Rekognition, specifically focusing on Rekognition Custom Labels.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following in place:

- AWS account with necessary permissions.
- Terraform installed locally.


## Workflow Overview

1. **Manual Image Upload:**
   - Users manually upload images to an S3 bucket(any desired naming of your choice).

2. **S3 Event Trigger:**
   - Configure S3 bucket to generate events for `PutObject` actions.

3. **Lambda Function:**
   - Set up a Lambda function to process uploaded images.
   - Grant Lambda necessary IAM permissions for S3 access.

4. **EventBridge Rule:**
   - Create an EventBridge rule to trigger Lambda on S3 events.
   - Customize the rule to match `PutObject` events.

5. **CloudWatch Logging:**
   - Configure CloudWatch Logs for Lambda function.
   - Set up CloudWatch Metric Alarms for monitoring.



## Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Integration

1. **Rekognition Setup:**
   - Ensure you have the Amazon Rekognition service and specifically **Rekognition Custom Labels** enabled in your AWS account.

2. **Custom Labels Project:**
   - Create a Rekognition Custom Labels project in the AWS Management Console.
   - Choose "Image" as the project type.
