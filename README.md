# rekognition


draft planning

- aws rekoginition
- terraform

- aws ecs
- s3
- cloudwatch

So I want to use the AWS Rekognition model that will be used to detect images of Ronaldo and Messi(might change this lagter, allow me brainstorm, the idea is there. Just need what to focus it on).
- Create a Dockerfile.
-  A flask application.
- Save my Docker Image to AWS ECR. 
- Store my Images on S3.
- Create EC2 Instances.


Wow, so i have not writing code for a while, i will exaplain my reasons later, it is all part of burnouts, so when i spot one, i know what to do.

I am watching Bundesliga Videos/Highlights and how they use AWS to get certain key match data, honestly that is amazing and it is on a larger scale of production, I am highly thinking of doing something similar but low scale, or just use photos to detect photos of football stars, I have a lot of ideas about this project.
